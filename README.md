# React_Project
I am currently in the process of learning the skills of a Frontend Developer. So I have started with learning React. This is a project I followed along from Tech With Tim. The video URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&list=PL4J1F6lmBx-XsSP_L6suYvoGFOiH5EJzP&index=3. The project was creating a website to view current popular movies as Movie Cards in a grid format. We could search for any movies we wanted. Another feature was watching movies and having them appear in a favorites tab. Overall I learned a lot about how state works in React, how to create and use Components, and how to use Context. I used the TMBD (https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to fetch the movie data for this project.
